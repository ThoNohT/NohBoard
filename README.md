# NohBoard

NohBoard is a keyboard visualization program. I know certain applications already exist that do just this, display your keyboard on-screen. And even more probably. However, so far I have found none that were both free and easy to use. That's where this program came in, I made it to be free and easy to use, without any fancy graphics, and easily capturable (possibly with chroma key). Furthermore, it's very customizable.

## Rewrite

An initial version was made in C++, this originated from the desire to make something with graphics, and what I knew was [OBS](http://github.com/jp9000/OBS), now replaced by [OBS Studio](http://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio). That's why I started in the same spirit, using C++, and rendering with DirectX. However, having spent most of my time on C# during at least the last decade or so, I decided that I would be much more able to create awesome things in this language. That's when I re-started. Rather than using DirectX, I switched to GDI+, as we're Windows only (I'm sorry, but I just really don't use any other OS, and so far it is still the go-to OS for gaming). No really fancy graphics are required, no 3D is required. This also makes it easier to capture, as a simple window capture in OBS will do the trick now, rather than having to fiddle with game capture which might not work due to a game typically being run at the same time as NohBoard.
